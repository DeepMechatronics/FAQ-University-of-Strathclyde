Congrats on receiving offers, the uni is exceptional in regards to research and learning environment it offers; as for the job prospects in the UK there are ample opportunities there, but the point is you got to convince/prove to the employers that you are worth there time and resources.

Can't comment on that since I don't know much about the Uni of Bath... I would suggest defining certain parameters base on your preferences, gather data, analyse and decide (Do you own research)...if you have any specific query regarding Strathclyde I will be happy to help in that regards...

Sure, I believe it my responsibility to contribute back to society, I do no mind sharing info if it can help others. I fact was quite prompt to respond the previous 3 guys before you with a comprehensive review on the University of Strathclyde. However, this time around, I am questioning my decision. Like is it worth doing it? I give all info they need and then after a thank note from them, I never hear back from them. Basically, my insight about society is still the same, while others have a lot to take away from the conversation. So, this time around let's do things a bit different, you give me the info I need, and I give you the info you need. You might be thinking, what a weird guy, this dude has turned out to be a crazy freak, but well, that‚Äôs how the things are. It‚Äôs fun that way.

I will need info on‚Ä¶

1. What is the perspective of other people about the University Strathclyde?
2. What's your vision? What do you really what to do? ‚Ä¶ life in industry or academia which one would you prefer.
3.Automation? You seem to have good experience in the industry so tell me what your thought on the company you worked with, the work culture, the opportunity of growth and the overall of the scope of automation in India from your perspective.

What info I can provide in return‚Ä¶

1.The overall and relevant facts about studying at the University of Strathclyde based on which you can generate your option about the university.
2.My personal thought about university.
3. Measures university took before and during this global pandemic and its effects on academic study. As for the future, I cannot comment at the moment, these are strange times.

1) I talked to Amruta, she couldn't give me a proper answer regarding the university, rest of the people didn't even respond when I asked about the university.
2) I want to gain industrial knowledge about this course so I can use it to build my own business in this field
3) I've worked with a few Industries. I feel India lacks a lot of technical knowhow as well as smooth implementation of Automation projects which I think I will be able to bridge gap by doing Masters

Awesome!!

Here is my bit, but first my reaction to your reply‚Ä¶

1.Amrutha? ya , man she can be trick some time‚Ä¶you see I can ask my peers directly if I had to but will it has given the perspective of the outsider? Here is an analogy if it helps. Consider ‚ÄúAnime‚Äù, If I ask a person who is into anime about their thoughts on it. They might probably say things like it‚Äôs a thrilling adventure, a slice of life, poetic and so on. But if I ask the same question to an outsider, how have never watched anime or heard about it might say it‚Äôs a dumb cartoon of 5-year-old. So, can you see where I am getting at right? Most people have their own bias in their perspective depending on their exposure to things around them. For me, it‚Äôs important to understand because‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..*as if I am going to type it*‚Ä¶..anyways I guess you gave your best shot‚Ä¶

2.Thats Excellent!!

3.Hmmm‚Ä¶ that interesting.

So now the main thing what you are here for (about how the course is in Strathclyde University?)‚Ä¶.

A. Here are some facts on the course at Strathclyde University

‚Ä¢	Plagiarism is a crime and punishable offence in any form.

‚Ä¢	DM931 Assigns an Industrial project to the group where student act as consultant and work will their client to solve their problem.

‚Ä¢	For DM931 student also get a chance to meet an existing industrial expert consultant in the field to review the student‚Äôs work on Industrial project and get feedback from them.

‚Ä¢	Get comprehensive and critical feedback on coursework summited

‚Ä¢	More coursework‚Äôs less written exam.

B. Here‚Äôs my take on the university course

‚Ä¢	More self-study and no spoon feeding so I prefer that

‚Ä¢	Lecturer are like sage, very knowledgeable they would subtly make you realise stuff which you never thought of and plant a seed on which you can grow your understanding.

‚Ä¢	Staffs are friendly, approachable and without any form of discrimination and bias.

‚Ä¢	Exposed to Industry is great through this course

C. Here are the measures the uni took.

‚Ä¢	16/3/2020 cancelled all face to face teaching

‚Ä¢	21/3/2020 access to library and other facility closed.

‚Ä¢	23/3/2020 all teaching online through Zoom

‚Ä¢	Set up COVID 19 hardship fund to the student struggling with finance due to crisis.

‚Ä¢	The Disability & Wellbeing Service is operating remotely and continues to provide advice and support about disability, mental health, physical health and wellbeing.

‚Ä¢	For academic learning perspective surely, things were rough when it started. Project scope changed to make it suitable to do it from home, getting coursework done before deadline became difficult. However, Extension service was generous to give up to 2 weeks if Covid-19 based circumstance. And coursework‚Äôs tasks were modifying while maintaining the knowledge gain standard for some course.

‚Ä¢	Currently stage, the most postgraduate student would have only had their master thesis left so things are chill.





Kkk‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.



Kind regards,

Deep

Bro, this course focuses more on Control Systems or Industrial Automation?
I went through the course content, felt like its more inclined towards Control Systems

Well, it's not necessarily inclined to control system...it an optional module subject among others...
 DM934  Design Methods                                               [10 credits]

EE972    Control Principles                                             [20 credits]

EE474    Robotic Systems and Control                       [10 credits]

DM945  Systems Thinking and Modelling                [10 credits].   Apart from this we had VIP rover..that's an interesting one...one thing I can criticise about is PLC programming and access to a lab with a robotic arm to control...that not straight forward, as that is not directly tied to curriculum .. u might have to bug around prof to convince them to access lab for learning to use them...

Hey Nikheel, Thanks for your kind words, you are the first to ever come back... most go to their mere ways after getting what they want to hear... So, UK?  should be fine ... Though I left the UK a while back, my brother is still there pursuing his PhD... lockdowns not much a problem for his uni, research is still going. Remember Amrutha, She is still in Strathclyde you might contact her if you seek to know about the exact current status there. 
 
At the moment, I am in India working as JRF. However, I am actively seeking PhD opportunities. Has Covid been an obstacle? NO!... sure things have changed... that just means I got to change my respond accordingly to get what I want... so anyways, hows stuff for you?

You are asking too many questions and I understand why. Let me tackle each one by one.

"Experience with the program"

To be unbiased I will start with facts

‚Ä¢ Plagiarism is a crime and punishable offence in any form there.
‚Ä¢ Get comprehensive and critical feedback on coursework summited
‚Ä¢ More coursework‚Äôs less written exam.
‚Ä¢ The curriculum meets the learning outcomes.

My take on the program

‚Ä¢ More self-study and no spoon-feeding. I prefer that
‚Ä¢ Lecturers are like sage, very knowledgeable they would subtly make you realise stuff which you never thought of and plant a seed on which you can grow your understanding. 
‚Ä¢ Staffs are friendly, approachable and without any form of discrimination and bias.
‚Ä¢ Exposed to Industry is great through this course
‚Ä¢ Their infrastructure to facilitate seams learning is commendable, the Library, Computer labs, Career services.

"Experience with the city"

As your know, Glasgow is at the centre of Scotland, Cityscape is green are great, so are the people, very humble and inclusive. It is a bit cold out there but I got used to it very quickly like won't mind jogging in shorts during winter.  Their something called daylight saver have that in mind.

"Expenses"

Essential goods cost roughly double that to India. Transport is damn expensive.
my monthly expensive was about 40 sterling (excluding rent and telecom). However, it has to be noted I was very frugal in expense and consumption there. expense depend very much on lifestyle.


"Scholarships"

 I got a ¬£ 3000 scholarship for academic excellence which was compensated in tuition fees. There were people with commonwealth scholarships there.

"The job opportunities"

part-time: plenty but very difficult core related. I worked as a safety steward, I have seen others as bartender, waiter,  warehouse loading ...

Full time: Very very competitive especially for international but not impossible. I would convince you are worthy then other people will hire, mostly big tech, startup refrain for tier 2 sponsorship.

"Industrial group project"

‚Ä¢  DM931 Assigns an Industrial project to the group where students act as consultants and work will their client to solve their problems.
‚Ä¢ For DM931 students also get a chance to meet an existing industrial expert consultant in the field to review the student‚Äôs work on Industrial projects and get feedback from them.
‚Ä¢If you do most of the work you get more marks they have peer review in place.

I got Harbro Pvt Ltd... Others got Unilever, Jaguar, Rolls Royce and so on...


kkk...........

Kind regards,
Deep
